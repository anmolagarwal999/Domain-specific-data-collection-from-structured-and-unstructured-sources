      "<p>Wootters was probably born around 1951, given that he obtained his bachelor’s degree in 1973 from Stanford University. He earned his Ph.D. in physics in 1980 from the University of Texas at Austin, writing his dissertation on quantum information theory. During postdoctoral research at that school, Wootters worked with famed physicist John Archibald Wheeler. He is currently Barclay Jermain Professor of Natural Philosophy, Emeritus, in the Physics Department at Williams College.</p>\n",
      "<p>Wootters is known for several different advances in the theory of quantum computation. For instance, in a 1982 paper he co-authored with Wojciech H. Zurek, he proved the no-cloning theorem (also discovered independently by Dennis Dieks), a no-go theorem showing that it is impossible to “clone” (that is, produce an identical physical copy of) a single, arbitrary, unknown quantum state.<sup><a href=\"#note21\" id=\"text21\" title=\"See Footnote #21.\">[21]</a></sup> However, in later work with other colleagues on quantum entanglement, Wootters showed that quantum teleportation is still a theoretical possibility for known (fully described) systems. He is also credited with co-inventing the term “qubit” along with Benjamin Schumacher.</p>\n",

Adleman is best known for his contribution, together with Ronald L. Rivest and Adi Shamir (for both of whom, see below), to the RSA algorithm, which was one of the first public-key cryptosystems, and which remains in wide use to this day for the encryption of data transmission. Adleman also developed the theoretical foundations for the possible use of the DNA molecule as a means of doing complex calculations, earning him the sobriquet “Father of DNA Computing.” In addition, he is often credited with coining the term “computer virus.” Adleman won the A.M.

She retired from IBM in 2002, but still holds the title of IBM Fellow Emerita. While at IBM, Allen published many seminal papers, one of the most important of which was her classic 1966 paper, “Program Optimization”.[1] This paper\\u202f—\\u2009published internally by IBM while was she was working on an experimental compiler for the company’s Advanced Computing System (ACS-1) project\\u202f—\\u2009laid the conceptual basis for systematic evaluation and improvement of computer programs.

While teaching briefly at Harvard University (1978–1982), Clarke became Emerson’s dissertation advisor and the two men began to collaborate on the problem of programming such a verification procedure. In a joint paper delivered at a conference in May of 1981 and published the following year,[2] Clarke and Emerson proposed a solution to the verification problem by re-stating the specified algorithm and the model created to verify it as logical formulas in a precise mathematical language.[3] The task of verifying the specified structure thus becomes equivalent to the logical task of checking whether the structure satisfies a particular logical formula\\u202f—\\u2009namely, the one embodied by the model.

Notably, he is the originator of the seminal idea, first published in 1971, of NP-completeness (the “NP” stands for “nondeterministic polynomial time”). Basically, he proved the existence of programs (algorithms) that are reducible to NP-complete form, meaning they are “efficient” in the sense that they are tractable or feasible in terms of the time (and thus resources and expense) they require to reach a solution. The difficulty, however, is that there is no means of determining in advance which programs are NP-complete. In spite of this fundamental limitation, Cook’s contributions to the theory of computational complexity have had an incalculable impact on the entire field of computer science. A few years later, he proved the existence of efficient logical proof systems analogous to NP-complete computer programs\\u202f—\\u2009work which led to the entirely new discipline of proof complexity.

Feigenbaum is known as the “Father of Expert Systems,” which are artificial intelligence (AI) systems that are capable of emulating the performance of human experts in assessing situations and recommending actions within a particular field of knowledge. Expert systems have been widely applied in disciplines such as chemistry, medicine, geology, and computer science itself. The DENDRAL project, which Feigenbaum led at Stanford beginning in 1965, was the first practical expert system. Its purpose was to help organic chemists analyze unknown molecules on the basis of mass spectrometry data. As such, it was the first program to move AI out of the computer science lab and into the real world. Later on, Feigenbaum developed a number of other expert systems, which were essentially refinements of DENDRAL\\u202f—\\u2009notably MYCIN, which helped doctors isolate the bacterial pathogens for various infectious diseases.

In this paper, the authors introduced the idea of time hierarchy classes (essentially, degrees of complexity based on the time required by a calculation of a given type), and proved what is now known as the “time hierarchy theorem.” In 1977, Hartmanis published another pioneering paper, this time in collaboration with Leonard Berman, introducing the still-unsolved Berman–Hartmanis conjecture that all NP-complete languages are polynomial-time isomorphic.[7] Hartmanis received the A.M.

During his compulsory military service, he learned Russian. He did graduate work on statistics and computer programming, first back at Oxford, then at Moscow State University, where he studied under the great mathematician and pioneer of computational complexity theory, Andrey N.

After a number of years in private industry, Hoare became a Professor of Computing, first at Queen’s University, Belfast, then back at Oxford once again, where he led the Programming Research Group in what was then known as the Oxford University Computing Laboratory. He is currently Emeritus Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Oxford, as well as a Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research in Cambridge, England. Hoare began his career by working with Niklaus E. Wirth (see below) on ALGOL-W (implemented in 1966), an important extension of ALGOL, originally developed in 1958 by an international consortium. ALGOL\\u202f—\\u2009the direct ancestor of Pascal and C\\u202f—\\u2009was the first imperative-structured programming language, which most experts considered a major advance over competing languages of the time such as FORTRAN and COBOL.

Karp has made important theoretical advances in a number of different fields of computer science, combinatorial algorithms, and operations research. In 1971, he published, with Jack R. Edmonds, a paper laying out the Edmonds-Karp algorithm for solving the maximum flow problem for networks. The following year, he published a path-breaking paper in computational complexity theory in which he proved 21 problems to be NP-complete.[8] The year after that (1973), in collaboration with John E. Hopcroft (see above), Karp developed the Hopcroft–Karp algorithm, which to this day remains the fastest known method for finding maximum cardinality matchings in bipartite graphs. Later work for which he is also well known include the Karp-Lipton theorem\\u202f—\\u2009developed together with Richard J. Lipton\\u202f—\\u2009which is an important result in the Satisfiability Problem for Boolean circuit logic gates, as well as the Rabin-Karp string search algorithm, developed with Michael O.

He is currently President of the Viewpoints Research Institute, which he founded in 2001, as well as Adjunct Professor of Computer Science at UCLA. While working on his dissertation, Kay developed the FLEX programming language. His dissertation advisor at the University of Utah was Ivan E. Sutherland (see below), often referred to as the “Father of Computer Graphics.” During his work as a researcher at Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) facility in the early 1970s, Kay led a team that extended ideas he had already introduced in his dissertation into the language SMALLTALK, which they used as the basis for communication between networked workstations. SMALLTALK was one of the very first pure object-oriented languages (OOLs), and was eventually commercialized by Apple for their Lisa and Macintosh systems. Thus, Kay is often referred to as one of the “Fathers of OOLs.” While still at Xerox, he also made significant conceptual breakthroughs in two other areas, both in the Dynabook project, which was a computer originally aimed at children. Dynabook was the very first compact, mobile computer, and it also incorporated the first windowing graphical user interface (GUI) for interacting with the software program, as opposed to the earlier command line interface.

He received his Ph.D. in mathematics in 1963 from California Institute of Tchnology (CalTech). Knuth is currently Professor Emeritus of the Art of Computer Programming at Stanford University. Knuth has made outstanding contributions to three different areas of compute science: theoretical, practical, and pedagogical. At the theoretical level, he helped develop and systematize formal mathematical techniques for the rigorous analysis of the computational complexity of algorithms. In the process, he popularized asymptotic notation, which is used to classify algorithms according to how their running time or memory requirements grow as a function of the input size. At the practical level, Knuth developed the TeX computer typesetting system, the related METAFONT font rendering system, and the Computer Modern family of typefaces. He also designed the WEB and CWEB programming systems designed to encourage and facilitate literate programming, as well as the MIX/MMIX instruction set architectures. Finally, at the pedagogical level, his The Art of Computer Programming (see below) is widely regarded as a classic textbook. TAOCP, as it is widely known, enjoys a mystique among many computer scientists whose closest analogue is perhaps the esteem in which The Feynman Lectures on Physics is held by many physicists.

Rabin has done path-breaking work in several different fields of applied mathematics and logic, but the two areas to which he has made the most-outstanding contributions are computational complexity theory and cryptography. In the former, Rabin\\u202f—\\u2009in collaboration with Dana S. Scott (see below\\u202f—\\u2009introduced the notion of nondeterministic finite automata as a superior approach to determining whether a given algorithm can be solved effectively\\u202f—\\u2009that is, is solvable in polynomial time by a nondeterministic Turing machine (in other words, belongs to complexity class NP).[14] As to the latter, Rabin invented the Miller-Rabin primality test (arrived at independently by Gary L. Miller), a randomized algorithm that can determine very quickly (albeit with a small probability of error) whether a given number is prime. This test became the basis for what is now known as Rabin cryptography. Rabin won the A.M. Turing Award in 1976.\",\\n        \"place_of_birth\": \"Wrocław,Poland,Breslau,Germany\",\\n        \"year_of_birth\": \"1931\"\\n    },\\n    \"dabbala b.

In a nutshell, a particular aspect, or specification, of a complex computational system is first expressed as a set of specially designed temporal logic formulas, known as a model. An efficient algorithm can then be used to exhaustively and automatically check whether the model satisfies the original specification, thus verifying that aspect of the complex system. The procedure can then be repeated for other specifications of the system.

Solomon is known for her work on artificial intelligence and programming languages for educational purposes, especially introducing small children to basic computational concepts. She began to be interested in computers while working as a secretary for Marvin Minsky at MIT in the 1960s. While at MIT, she taught herself Lisp. She eventually left MIT to take a position as a Lisp programmer with Bolt, Beranek, and Newman (now BBN Technologies). However, she remained in close touch with her former MIT colleagues, and subsequently became heavily involved in the development, along with Seymour Papert, of the Logo programming language for small mobile robots known as “turtles,” aimed at teaching computational and other skills to young children. Radia J. Perlman (see above) later joined this group. In 1971, Solomon co-authored with Papert a widely circulated internal MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab memo[16] that sketched a vision for incorporating computers into early childhood education. After leaving BBN, Solomon co-founded Logo Computer Systems, Inc., where she served as Vice President for Research and Development during the time when the company was designing the famous Apple Computer Company logo.

In later work in collaboration with Philip M. Lewis and Daniel J.

In work with Harry B.

Tarjan is best known for his pioneering theoretical work in applied mathematics, especially on graph structure algorithms and data structures. As to the former, he is the inventor of Tarjan’s off-line lowest common ancestors algorithm, Tarjan’s strongly connected components algorithm, and (with several co-workers) the median of medians linear time selection algorithm. Working with John E. Hopcroft (see above), he also developed the Hopcroft-Tarjan planarity testing algorithm, the first linear-time algorithm for planarity-testing (determining whether a given graph can be drawn in the plane without edge intersections). As to the latter (i.e., data structures), he developed both the Fibonacci heap (a data structure for priority queue operations, consisting of a collection of heap-ordered trees) and, in collaboration with Daniel Sleator, the splay tree (a self-adjusting, binary search tree).

He followed this paper up within another one two years later,[18] which described in much greater detail the logical and physical requirements on quantum mechanical Hamiltonian models of Turing machines. In addition to penning this pair of ground-breaking papers, Benioff was also a noted public advocate of quantum computing, who played a key role in persuading the wider scientific community to take the idea seriously. Especially influential in this regard was a talk he gave at the “First Conference on the Physics of Computation,” held in May of 1981 at MIT (the paper was published the following year).[19] In addition to his pioneering work on quantum computing, Benioff has also made significant contributions to mathematics and theoretical physics more generally, notably in his research on the effects of number scaling and local mathematics on physics and geometry.\",\\n        \"place_of_birth\": \"Pasadena,California\",\\n        \"year_of_birth\": \"1930\"\\n    },\\n    \"charles h. bennett\": {\\n        \"name\": \"Charles H.

In 1982 he advanced a new refutation of Maxwell’s demon based on the thermodynamic cost of destroying information (namely, erasing a Turing machine’s tape).

In 1973 he published the theorem that has come to be named after him (also known as Holevo’s bound), which established an upper bound on the amount of classical information that can be extracted from a given ensemble of quantum states. This quantity is referred to as the ensemble’s “accessible information.” Holevo has also developed the theory of quantum communication channels (including the notion of “Holevo additivity” with respect to channel capacity), various coding theorems in quantum information theory, the noncommutative theory of statistical decisions, and the structure of quantum Markov semigroups and measurement processes.\",\\n        \"place_of_birth\": \"Russia,USSR\",\\n        \"year_of_birth\": \"1943\"\\n    },\\n    \"william k. wootters\": {\\n        \"name\": \"William K.

He earned his Ph.D. in physics in 1980 from the University of Texas at Austin, writing his dissertation on quantum information theory. During postdoctoral research at that school, Wootters worked with famed physicist John Archibald Wheeler. He is currently Barclay Jermain Professor of Natural Philosophy, Emeritus, in the Physics Department at Williams College. Wootters is known for several different advances in the theory of quantum computation. For instance, in a 1982 paper he co-authored with Wojciech H. Zurek, he proved the no-cloning theorem (also discovered independently by Dennis Dieks), a no-go theorem showing that it is impossible to “clone” (that is, produce an identical physical copy of) a single, arbitrary, unknown quantum state.[21] However, in later work with other colleagues on quantum entanglement, Wootters showed that quantum teleportation is still a theoretical possibility for known (fully described) systems. He is also credited with co-inventing the term “qubit” along with Benjamin Schumacher.\",\\n        \"place_of_birth\": \"\",\\n        \"year_of_birth\": \"1973\"\\n    }\\n}'"
